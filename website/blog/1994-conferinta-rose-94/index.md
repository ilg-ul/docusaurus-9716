## ROSE '94 - The Romanian Open Systems Conference & Exhibition (Bucharest, 3-5th November 1994)

This year on 3-5th of November, GURU, Romanian UNIX User Group was the host for EurOpen GB Meeting. Just before this, GURU organized the International Open Systems Event - ROSE '94 (Conference & Exhibition).

Some of the important speakers invited by GURU were: Richard Stallman, Elisabeth Zwicky, Philip Zimmermann and Chet Ramey. Unfortunately Elisabeth Zwicky was ill. So she could not come. Apart from missing her presence we regret that we had nobody from USENIX present at these events.

Some other speakers provided on behalf of EurOpen were: Kim Biel Nielsen, the chair of EurOpen, Simon Kenyon (IUUG), Mick Farmer (UKUUG), Etienne Remillon (AFUU), Jean-Michel Cornu (AFUU), Marten van Gelderen (NLUUG), Emile van Dantzig (NLUUG), Sergei Kuznetsov (SUUG), Mario Zagar (HrOpen), Zoltan Porkolab (HUUG).

A point of attraction for all participants were the spontaneous discussions outside the conference hall after some presentations. For example after Richard Stallman's presentation (20 minutes in the conference hall) the outside discussion was for almost an hour.

26 companies from Romania and abroad joined the Exhibition Area. This year, most of them provided speakers from the technical departments from Romania and abroad. In this way their presentations were not strictly promotional but technical too.

Full Internet access was possible for all the visitors. Some demonstrations with different navigation tools were organized by the companies.

In the GURU's booth free software was distributed and practiced. A lot of Proceedings, magazines and advertising materials from EurOpen, USENIX, UniForum, X/Open and GURU were displayed in the same booth. Due to these materials and due to the conference in general many participants decided to join GURU as new members

Two Romanian Computer publication groups and some newspapers were present. Up to now they continued to publish interviews from the meetings.

There were more than 700 subscribed participants in the conference and more than 1500 visitors during the events. This number is very big for a Romanian conference especially on Open Systems, a subject which is not very familiar in Romania.

GURU had some local technical support for organizing ROSE '94. All the organizers used pagers from a sponsor paging company and simultaneous translation was provided by another sponsor.

Initially the conference was planned and announced for two days (3-4th November) but due to the large number of good submitted papers the Program Committee proposed to add a third day for the conference (3-5th November).

The EurOpen GB was organized on Saturday and Sunday as usual (5-6th November). 3 members from GURU board could attend this time the meeting.

Monday morning (7th of November) Richard Stallman offered a presentation to the students from Computer Science Department at the University „Politehnica” Bucharest.

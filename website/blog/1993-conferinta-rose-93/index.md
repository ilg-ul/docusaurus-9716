## ROSE '93 - general overview

ROSE '93 was organised on two tracks:

- technical conference hall
- demonstration area of the companies (18 companies)

ROSE '93 had 230 participants (this means proceeding owners) but arround 400 visiting participants in the 2 days.

The official languages of the conference were Romanian and English and all Romanian and French presentations were simultaneously translated into English.

Most of the debates were continued in the demonstration area.

The sessions of ROSE '93 were:

- Invited papers session, chairman: Alexandru Rotaru, GURU
- Networking papers session, chairman: Vince Hovanek, Sprint International
- Technical papers session, chairman: Michael Beier, SunSoft
- Free software session, chairman: Sergei Kuznetsov, SUUG

We invited Mr. Richard Stallman president of FSF to talk at ROSE '93 by a satellite link from Washington DC. Unfortunately at the last moment Mr. Stallman had an accident and he could not reach Washington for ROSE '93. Instead of this, his message was presented during Free software session, and a printout of GNU Manifesto from FSF, received from him for ROSE '93, has been distributed.

An excellent idea was to present the „free software drive” from the paper of Mr. Marius Hancu. This solved again a lot of informational barriers which still exist in Romania. The attendees could get the last status of this hard work which is in continue development. An offer from GURU was made for providing linux and other programms from the free software drive collection.

A team of students from Technical Univesity Cluj, lead by professor Kalman Pusztai helped the organisers in many ways. They sorted and arranged the papers for proceedings, and were presented at the hotels, railway station and TAROM agency in order to be guides for the guests.

The SOROS Foundation Branch Cluj helped us in providing all necessary equipment for simultaneously translation. It was the first time when this instalation was used in Romania.

The IIRUC branches from Bucharest and mainly from Cluj suceeded in organising the whole flow of events: hotel reservation, transport of equipment and people in Cluj, registration area, distribution of the conference package to the attendees and other current tasks. This team was lead by Mr. Dan Barlutiu, IIRUC-Cluj and Mr. Alexandru Rotaru, IIRUC-Bucharest.

Special thanks to Mr. Adrian Ivanov, ITC Cluj and vice-chairman of GURU, who spended mostly all his time in helping to organise the whole event.

We also thank to Mr. Liviu Iftode for sending a presentation about „the history of UNIX in Romania” which was presented during the 1st day of ROSE '93.

If we forgot to mention somebody it is not because her (his) participation was not important for us.

Alexandru Rotaru GURU Chairman,
Irina Athanasiu professor PUB
